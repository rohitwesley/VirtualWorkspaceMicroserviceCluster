## Prerequisites

- Docker (v20.10.0 or later)
- Git (v2.25.0 or later)
- Docker Compose
- Node.js (v14+)
- Redis Stack
- Unity (optional, for Unity client integration)

## Setting Up SSH for Microservers

Generate an SSH key, add it to your GitHub account, verify the connection, and install the 'hub' tool for repository management. Detailed steps can be found in [INFO_ProjMang](INFO_PROJMANG.md).

## Project Folder Structure

- `Doxygen`: Generated Doxygen documentation.
- `microservices`: Live microservice submodules.
- `research-microservices`: Research microservice submodules.
- Additional key files: `README`, `INFO_Doc`, `INFO_ProjMang`, `.env`, `.gitignore`, `Doxfile`, `LICENSE`.

## Working with GitFlow Branches

GitFlow organizes project branches and releases efficiently. For usage instructions, refer to [INFO_ProjMang](INFO_PROJMANG.md).

## Setting Up Submodules

Submodules allow including microservice repositories within the main repository. Setup guidance is available in [INFO_ProjMang](INFO_PROJMANG.md).

## Environment Setup

Setup an Anaconda Environment as the Virtual Workspace Microservice Cluster Network Environment. Refer to [Python Microservice README](microservers/python-microserver/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Cloud Setup

Configure the project for cloud environments following the steps in [Cloud Setup](INFO_CLOUD.md).

## Doxygen Documentation

Access and generate Doxygen documentation for each microservice with instructions in [INFO_Doc](INFO_DOC.md).

## Further Resources

- Project documentation and management: [INFO_Doc](INFO_DOC.md), [INFO_ProjMang](INFO_PROJMANG.md).
- Cloud management: [CLOUD_SETUP](INFO_CLOUD.md).
