## Project `.gitignore`

A `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It helps prevent accidentally committing unnecessary files to the repository. Here's a basic `.gitignore` file that you can use for your "Visual Workspace Microserver Cluster" project. It includes common files and directories that are often ignored in software projects:
```
# .gitignore

# Ignore system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore files related to code editors and IDEs
.vscode/
.idea/
*.iml
*.swp
*.swo

# Ignore compiled files and build artifacts
*.o
*.lo
*.la
*.so
*.dylib
*.dll
*.exe
*.out

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
*.bak

# Ignore Node.js dependencies
node_modules/

# Ignore Python build and cache files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/

# Ignore Ruby gems
*.gem
*.rbc
/.config
/coverage/
/InstalledFiles
/pkg/
/spec/reports/
/spec/examples.txt
/test/tmp/
/tmp/

# Ignore Java build files
*.class
*.jar
*.war
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# Ignore generated files and directories
bin/
gen/
out/

```
>Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root directory of your repository and paste the contents above into the file. This will help prevent unnecessary files from being tracked by Git. You can customize this file to fit the specific needs of your project and its components.

## Project tags
When you execute the command `git tag -a dummy-release`, Git will open your default text editor, which in your case is Vim, to input the tag message (similar to a commit message).

In Vim, follow these steps to add a tag message and save the changes:

1. Press `i` to enter insert mode. This allows you to edit the file and input your tag message.

2. Type your tag message, such as "Dummy release for GitFlow setup."

3. Press the `Esc` key to exit insert mode.

4. To save the changes and exit Vim, type `:wq` and press Enter. The colon : enters command-line mode in Vim, `w` stands for "write" (save), and q stands for "quit" (exit).

If you want to discard your changes and exit without saving, type `:q!` and press `Enter`.

Now, your `dummy-release` tag will be created with the specified message. To view the tag message, run `git show dummy-release`.

## Recover Deleted Branch:

If you accidentally deleted a branch using `git branch -d feature/dummy-feature` or `git branch -D feature/dummy-feature`, you can undo the deletion by finding the last commit on the deleted branch and creating a new branch pointing to that commit.

Follow these steps to recover the deleted branch:

1. Find the last commit on the deleted branch using the git reflog command:
```
git reflog
```
Look for an entry in the reflog that refers to the deleted branch, for example:
```
d123456 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from feature/dummy-feature to main
```
In this case, `d123456` is the commit hash of the last commit on the deleted branch.

2. Create a new branch pointing to the last commit on the deleted branch:
```
git checkout -b feature/dummy-feature d123456
```
Replace `d123456` with the actual commit hash you found in step 1.

Now, you have successfully recovered the deleted branch, and it is pointing to the last commit before the deletion. If you made any changes to the branch after the last commit, those changes may be lost, and you'll need to reapply them manually.
